## David Smalley

Over the past five years, I have made a career out of the Informational Technology field as a Jr. Web Developer, IT Asset Manager, IT Support Specialist blended in with countless programming projects to further my career.

My former position as a Jr. Web Developer only scratches the surface of where my ambition lies. I maintained the company’s content management systems on the e-commerce platform, Magento as well as the popular website creation tool, WordPress. While running quality assurance on our websites to ensure customer satisfaction.

As an Asset Manager, which gravitated around a fast pace, ever changing environment; problem solving at a moment’s notice was crucial. I was able to meet the demands and deadlines, amid rebuilding the position from the ground up to better suit the needs of a growing company. I negotiated competitive pricing with retailers. Created purchase orders, reports & workflows. I lead company-wide asset audits in addition to the installation and support for all software, hardware and services as a IT Support Specialist.

In my current position, I have been able to provide technical support to fellow colleagues amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic work from home initiative. While we find ourselves indoors during these difficult times, I am taking my time and refining my programming skills through online courses and passion projects. With over 15 years customer service to weave in, I am looking for an opportunity to take advantage of my expertise again and bring value to a software engineering position. I can provide a resume upon request. Thank you for your consideration.


I look forward to hearing from you soon.
